        <h1>Musical nights/day</h1>
        <p><small>Here are a few quick examples:</small></p>
        <p>Do me a favor: Try humming the first few lines of Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. Now hum the first few lines of the Alphabet Song and Baa Baa Black Sheep. Sound familiar? There are multiple songs that either follow a similar rhythm or use the same notes, and can be easily mixed up if you are listening to just the instrumentals. 

            If you are creating a puzzle that requires players to identify a song via an instrumental rendition, make sure it is unique. Have a few others test the puzzle out to see if they all come up with the same answer.</p>

        <p>Play the Jurassic Park theme to lead players to a favorite stuffed dinosaur. 

            Play “Who Let the Dogs Out” by the Baha Men to lead players to a dog’s leash, or to the dog itself.
            
            Play “Hedwig’s Theme” from the Harry Potter soundtrack to lead players to a physical clue hidden in a set of Harry Potter books or movies.
            
            Play the classic church tune, “He’s Got the Whole World in His Hands”, to lead players to a globe or map.</p>
